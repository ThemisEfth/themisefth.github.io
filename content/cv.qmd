Welcome to my website. Below, you can find my CV outlining my professional experience, research contributions, and expertise. For inquiries, contact me at [themiftw20\@gmail.com](themiftw20@gmail.com).

## Areas of Expertise and Interest

-   Social cognitive and affective neuroscience
-   Electroencephalography (EEG)
-   Facial expression production and processing
-   Biological motion production and processing
-   Statistical software: Matlab, JASP, R, Python
-   Facial Electrical Stimulation
-   Open Science principles
-   Peripheral physiology: HR, GSR

## Professional Profile

I am a methodological researcher with a PhD in Psychology from the University of Essex, specialising in social and cognitive neuroscience. My expertise integrates advanced quantitative methods, such as multilevel modelling and machine learning, with physiological and longitudinal data to investigate complex social interactions.

Currently, I am a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Edinburgh, where I study the influence of social context on interactions between autistic and non-autistic individuals as part of the Diversity in Social Intelligence Project. I focus on video-based analyses of non-verbal synchrony and the interplay between verbal and motor behaviours.

I have developed facial neuromuscular electrical stimulation (fNMES) to study its effects on emotion perception, employing innovative methods like EEG and video analysis. I thrive in interdisciplinary teams, handle complex datasets, recruit participants, and create analytical tools. I am deeply committed to open science practices and collaborative research.
