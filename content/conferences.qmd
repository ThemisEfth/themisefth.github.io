## Emotions 2023

**Symposium**\
**Tilburg, Netherlands**\
**September 2023\

## Second Bodily and Cognitive Selves Eastern Arc Workshop

**Poster Presentation**\
**Essex University, Colchester, UK**\
**13 June\
[Download Poster](../materials/posters/EastArc_2022.pdf)**

![Eastern Arc Workshop Poster Presentation](../images/conference_images/EARC_2022.jpg){width="500"}

I presented a poster at the Second Bodily and Cognitive Selves Eastern Arc Workshop, held at Essex University in Colchester, UK. The workshop brought together researchers from Essex, UEA, and Kent to explore interdisciplinary perspectives on bodily and cognitive selves. My poster focused on the interplay between facial neuromuscular electrical stimulation (fNMES) and emotional perception, highlighting preliminary findings on user experiences and the potential cognitive and affective implications of this novel technique.

This presentation contributed to discussions on innovative methods for studying embodied cognition and emotions within the context of interdisciplinary research.

## British Neuroscience Association (BNA) 2021

**Symposium**\
**Virtual Conference**\
**April 2021\
[Download Poster](../materials/posters/BNA_2021.pdf)**

![BNA 2021 Conference](../images/conference_images/BNA_2021.jpg){fig-align="left" width="500"}

I participated in the British Neuroscience Association (BNA) 2021 virtual conference, where I presented research on participant concerns regarding the prospect of receiving facial neuromuscular electrical stimulation (fNMES). The talk explored user perspectives, highlighting apprehensions about safety, comfort, and the psychological impact of fNMES. This research aimed to inform ethical and user-centred approaches for future applications of fNMES in both experimental and clinical settings.
