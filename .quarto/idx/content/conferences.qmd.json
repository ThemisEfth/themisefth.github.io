The workshop brought together researchers from Essex, UEA, and Kent to explore interdisciplinary perspectives on bodily and cognitive selves. My poster focused on the interplay between facial neuromuscular electrical stimulation (fNMES) and emotional perception, highlighting preliminary findings on user experiences and the potential cognitive and affective implications of this novel technique.\n\nThis presentation contributed to discussions on innovative methods for studying embodied cognition and emotions within the context of interdisciplinary research.\n\n[Visit the workshop website for more information.](https://easternarc.ac.uk/news/registration-open-for-earc-workshop-on-bodily-and-cognitive-selves/)\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n## British Neuroscience Association (BNA) 2021\n\n**Symposium**\\\n**Virtual Conference**\\\n**April 2021\\\n[Download Poster](../materials/posters/BNA_2021.pdf)**\n\n![BNA 2021 Conference](../images/conference_images/BNA_2021.jpg){fig-align=\"left\" width=\"500\"}\n\nI participated in the British Neuroscience Association (BNA) 2021 virtual conference, where I presented research on participant concerns regarding the prospect of receiving facial neuromuscular electrical stimulation (fNMES).
