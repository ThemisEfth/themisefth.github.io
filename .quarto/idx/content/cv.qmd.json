My expertise integrates advanced quantitative methods, such as multilevel modelling and machine learning, with physiological and longitudinal data to investigate complex social interactions.\n\nCurrently, I am a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Edinburgh, where I study the influence of social context on interactions between autistic and non-autistic individuals as part of the Diversity in Social Intelligence Project. I focus on video-based analyses of non-verbal synchrony and the interplay between verbal and motor behaviours.\n\nI have developed facial neuromuscular electrical stimulation (fNMES) to study its effects on emotion perception, employing innovative methods like EEG and video analysis. I thrive in interdisciplinary teams, handle complex datasets, recruit participants, and create analytical tools. I am deeply committed to open science practices and collaborative research.\n\n### Bibliometrics (August 2023)\n\n-   **Citations:** 28 (Google Scholar)\n-   **h-index:** 4 (Google Scholar)\n-   **Peer-reviewed publications:** 5\n-   **Conference presentations:** 5\n\n## Research Experience\n\n### <i class=\"fas fa-flask\"></i> Postdoctoral Researcher \\| University of Edinburgh (2024–Present)\n\n-   Conducting research on social interactions between autistic and non-autistic adults.\n-   Analysing non-verbal synchrony using advanced computer vision techniques.\n-   Promoting inclusivity and open science principles.\n\n#### Key Outcomes:\n\n1.
