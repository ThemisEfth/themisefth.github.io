My most important new tool wasn't a software package, but the patient technician who taught me how to connect a cable without setting off the fire alarm.\n\nThis collision of worlds was profoundly challenging. It meant learning to translate 'statistical power' into a language an artist could appreciate, and 'aesthetic integrity' into a concept an engineer could work with. I quickly realised that the most innovative solutions didn't come from any single field, but from the productive friction generated between them.\n\nMy biggest takeaway was that true multidisciplinary research isn't just about borrowing tools. It’s a fundamental shift in perspective. It's recognising the limits of your own toolkit and having the humility to see a problem through someone else's eyes.
