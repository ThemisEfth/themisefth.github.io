My research has helped refine the Facial Feedback Hypothesis, bridging theoretical models with practical applications in emotion science.\nCurrently, I’m at the University of Edinburgh, contributing to groundbreaking research on neurodiversity in social interactions. I study the unique ways autistic and non-autistic individuals engage with one another, blending behavioural science, advanced data analysis, and open science principles to understand and improve human connection.\nWhether developing innovative tools or rethinking traditional approaches, my research is driven by the belief that understanding emotion and social interaction has the power to enhance well-being and inclusivity."

    "section": "About Me",
    "text": "About Me\nDuring my PhD at the University of Essex, I developed cutting-edge, non-invasive techniques for facial electrical stimulation, providing a new lens to examine how facial expressions shape emotional experiences. My research has helped refine the Facial Feedback Hypothesis, bridging theoretical models with practical applications in emotion science.\nCurrently, I’m at the University of Edinburgh, contributing to groundbreaking research on neurodiversity in social interactions. I study the unique ways autistic and non-autistic individuals engage with one another, blending behavioural science, advanced data analysis, and open science principles to understand and improve human connection.\nWhether developing innovative tools or rethinking traditional approaches, my research is driven by the belief that understanding emotion and social interaction has the power to enhance well-being and inclusivity."
