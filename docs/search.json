My research has helped refine the Facial Feedback Hypothesis, bridging theoretical models with practical applications in emotion science.\nCurrently, I’m at the University of Edinburgh, contributing to groundbreaking research on neurodiversity in social interactions. I study the unique ways autistic and non-autistic individuals engage with one another, blending behavioural science, advanced data analysis, and open science principles to understand and improve human connection.\nWhether developing innovative tools or rethinking traditional approaches, my research is driven by the belief that understanding emotion and social interaction has the power to enhance well-being and inclusivity."

    "section": "About Me",
    "text": "About Me\nMy research journey has been focused on developing and applying quantitative methods to understand the nuances of human experience.\nDuring my PhD at the University of Essex, I specialised in experimental design and advanced statistical analysis. I managed a four-year research programme that involved directing randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and developing novel methodologies. This work provided robust empirical evidence to test and refine a foundational theory in emotion science.\nAs a Postdoctoral Researcher at the University of Edinburgh, I focused on the dynamics of neurodiverse social interactions. I led end-to-end analysis projects on complex, multimodal datasets and engineered new data processing systems. To support the wider research community, I also developed and published 'duet', an R package on CRAN that enhances the transparency and reproducibility of social interaction research.\nHaving completed my postdoctoral position, I am now seeking new opportunities where my analytical skills can contribute to evidence-based solutions in either an academic or applied setting."

    "title": "From SPSS to Soldering Irons: My Journey into Multidisciplinary Research",
    "section": "",
    "text": "When I started in psychological research, my world was straightforward: run a simple experiment, collect some data, and plug it into SPSS for a neat ANOVA. Bob’s your uncle, research done. The idea that I’d one day be discussing signal detection models, let alone wielding a soldering iron, was completely off my radar.\nBut my PhD threw me into the deep end. The project began as an unlikely trio: two psychologists and a performance artist. Soon, our lab meetings felt less like a psychology working group and more like a United Nations of disciplines. An engineer joined to build our hardware, a computer scientist became my co-supervisor, and a data scientist co-authored our first paper. My most important new tool wasn’t a software package, but the patient technician who taught me how to connect a cable without setting off the fire alarm.\nThis collision of worlds was profoundly challenging. It meant learning to translate ‘statistical power’ into a language an artist could appreciate, and ‘aesthetic integrity’ into a concept an engineer could work with. I quickly realised that the most innovative solutions didn’t come from any single field, but from the productive friction generated between them.\nMy biggest takeaway was that true multidisciplinary research isn’t just about borrowing tools. It’s a fundamental shift in perspective. It’s recognising the limits of your own toolkit and having the humility to see a problem through someone else’s eyes. I learned that the messy, often confusing, process of collaboration isn’t a bug in the system—it’s the feature that drives discovery."
