## Welcome

Hi, Iâ€™m Themis Nikolas Efthimiou, a quantitative researcher dedicated to addressing complex social and behavioural questions. My work involves applying rigorous statistical methods and innovative tools to translate complex human data into evidence-based insights for policy and strategy.

## About Me

My research journey has been focused on developing and applying quantitative methods to understand the nuances of human experience.

During my PhD at the University of Essex, I specialised in experimental design and advanced statistical analysis. I managed a four-year research programme that involved directing randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and developing novel methodologies. This work provided robust empirical evidence to test and refine a foundational theory in emotion science.

As a Postdoctoral Researcher at the University of Edinburgh, I focused on the dynamics of neurodiverse social interactions. I led end-to-end analysis projects on complex, multimodal datasets and engineered new data processing systems. To support the wider research community, I also developed and published `'duet'`, an R package on CRAN that enhances the transparency and reproducibility of social interaction research.

Having completed my postdoctoral position, I am now seeking new opportunities where my analytical skills can contribute to evidence-based solutions in either an academic or applied setting.
